  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow produces a large number
  of abnormal blood cells. It can affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
  Blood stem cells in the bone marrow can develop into either myeloid or lymphoid stem cells.
  Myeloid stem cells mature into:
    - Red blood cells (oxygen transport)
    - Granulocytes and other white blood cells (immune response)
    - Platelets (blood clotting)
  Key information includes:
    - There are different subtypes of AML.
    - Risk factors include smoking, previous chemotherapy, and radiation exposure.
    - Common symptoms: fever, fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding.
    - Diagnosis involves blood and bone marrow tests.
    - Additional tests are done post-diagnosis to check cancer spread.
    - Patients may seek second opinions.
    - Prognosis and treatment depend on several individual factors.","- Includes structure of blood development from stem cells

      Guda et al. (2009) identified six different heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in GALNT12
      among 6 of 272 patients with late-onset colon cancer. These mutations affected catalytic or
      lectin-binding domains, led to decreased enzymatic activity, and were absent in 192 controls.

      TGF-beta signaling. ASE is dominantly inherited and increases CRC risk with an estimated odds

  Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mediates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal stress response.
  Transgenic mice overexpressing LIF in the developing pituitary have altered pituitary differentiation
  with expansion of corticotropes, maintenance of Rathke's cleft cysts, and suppression of all other pituitary cell types.
  Affymetrix GeneChips were used to identify modulators of LIF effects in corticotrope (AtT-20) and somatolactotrope (GH(3)) cells.
  Notably, C/EBPbeta and GIF were identified as transcriptional regulators of POMC and SOCS-3, and AHSG/fetuin as an inhibitor of LIF signaling.
